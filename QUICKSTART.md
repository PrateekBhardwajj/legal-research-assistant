# Quick Start Guide - Legal Research Assistant

## üöÄ Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# Run the setup script
python setup.py
```

This will:
- Install all Python dependencies
- Create necessary directories
- Create a template `.env` file
- Download required NLTK data

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# API Keys (Required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key-here  # Optional, uses ChromaDB by default
```

**Getting API Keys:**
- **OpenAI**: Sign up at [openai.com](https://openai.com) ‚Üí Account ‚Üí API Keys
- **Pinecone**: Sign up at [pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io) ‚Üí API Keys (optional)

### Step 3: Launch the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step 4: Upload Documents

1. Go to the **"üìÑ Document Management"** tab
2. Click **"Choose legal documents"**
3. Upload sample documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT):
   - We've included sample documents in `data/contracts/` and `data/case_law/`
4. Click **"üì§ Process Documents"**

### Step 5: Start Searching

1. Go to the **"üîç Search"** tab
2. Enter a legal query, for example:
   - "What are the termination clauses in employment contracts?"
   - "How are liquidated damages enforced?"
   - "What constitutes a material breach of contract?"
3. Click **"üîç Search"**

## üìã Sample Queries to Try

Once you've uploaded the sample documents, try these queries:

### Contract Analysis
- "What are the non-compete restrictions?"
- "How much notice is required for termination?"
- "What are the confidentiality obligations?"

### Case Law Research
- "What is the test for material breach of contract?"
- "When are liquidated damages enforceable?"
- "How does 'time is of the essence' affect contract performance?"

## üîß Configuration Options

### Vector Database Choice
- **ChromaDB** (default): Local, no setup required
- **Pinecone**: Cloud-based, requires API key and setup

Edit `config.yaml` to switch:
```yaml
vector_db:
  provider: "chromadb"  # or "pinecone"
```

### Model Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
```yaml
openai:
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # or "gpt-4"
  embedding_model: "text-embedding-ada-002"
  temperature: 0.1
```
